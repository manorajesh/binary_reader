C ERTIFICATION OF V ALIDITY
Publication of the certifying statement of the Archi-

PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO THE CON-
STITUTION NOT RATIFIED BY THE
STATES
In addition to the 27 amendments that have
been ratified by the required three-fourths of
the States, six other amendments have been
submitted to the States but have not been rati-
fied by them.
Beginning with the proposed Eighteenth
Amendment, Congress has customarily included
a provision requiring ratification within seven
years from the time of the submission to the
States. The Supreme Court in Coleman v. Miller,
307 U.S. 433 (1939), declared that the question of
the reasonableness of the time within which a
sufficient number of States must act is a politi-
cal question to be determined by the Congress.
In 1789, twelve proposed articles of amendment
were submitted to the States. Of these, Articles
III–XII were ratified and became the first ten
Page XIVCONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA—1787
amendments to the Constitution, popularly
known as the Bill of Rights. In 1992, proposed
Article II was ratified and became the 27th
amendment to the Constitution. Proposed Arti-
cle I which was not ratified is as follows:
‘‘A RTICLE THE FIRST
‘‘After the first enumeration required by the first ar-
ticle of the Constitution, there shall be one Representa-
tive for every thirty thousand, until the number shall
amount to one hundred, after which the proportion
shall be so regulated by Congress, that there shall be
not less than one hundred Representatives, nor less
than one Representative for every forty thousand per-
sons, until the number of Representatives shall amount
to two hundred; after which the proportion shall be so
regulated by Congress, that there shall not be less than
two hundred Representatives, nor more than one Rep-
resentative for every fifty thousand persons.’’
llll
Thereafter, in the 2d session of the Eleventh
Congress, the Congress proposed the following
article of amendment to the Constitution relat-
ing to acceptance by citizens of the United
States of titles of nobility from any foreign gov-
ernment.
The proposed amendment, which was not rati-
fied by three-fourths of the States, is as follows:
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America, in Congress assembled, Two
thirds of both Houses concurring, that the following
section be submitted to the legislatures of the several
states, which when ratified by the legislatures of three
fourths of the states, shall be valid and binding, as a
part of the constitution of the United States:
If any citizen of the United States shall accept,
claim, receive or retain any title of nobility or honor,
or shall, without the consent of Congress, accept and
retain any present, pension, office or emolument of any
kind whatever, from any emperor, king, prince or for-
eign power, such person shall cease to be a citizen of
the United States, and shall be incapable of holding
any office of trust or profit under them, or either of
them.
llll
The following amendment to the Constitution
relating to slavery was proposed by the 2d ses-
sion of the Thirty-sixth Congress on March 2,
1861, when it passed the Senate, having pre-
viously passed the House on February 28, 1861. It
is interesting to note in this connection that
this is the only proposed (and not ratified)
amendment to the Constitution to have been
signed by the President. The President’s signa-
ture is considered unnecessary because of the
constitutional provision that on the concur-
rence of two-thirds of both Houses of Congress
the proposal shall be submitted to the States for
ratification.
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That
the following article be proposed to the Legislatures of
the several States as an amendment to the Constitu-
tion of the United States, which, when ratified by
three-fourths of said Legislatures, shall be valid, to all
intents and purposes, as part of the said Constitution,
viz:
‘‘A RTICLE T HIRTEEN
‘‘No amendment shall be made to the Constitution
which will authorize or give to Congress the power to
abolish or interfere, within any State, with the domes-
tic institutions thereof, including that of persons held
to labor or service by the laws of said State.’’
llll
A child labor amendment was proposed by the
1st session of the Sixty-eighth Congress on June
2, 1926, when it passed the Senate, having pre-
viously passed the House on April 26, 1926. The
proposed amendment, which has been ratified by
28 States, to date, is as follows:
J OINT R ESOLUTION P ROPOSING AN A MENDMENT TO THE
C ONSTITUTION OF THE U NITED S TATES
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-
thirds of each House concurring therein), That the follow-
ing article is proposed as an amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, which, when ratified by
the legislatures of three-fourths of the several States,
shall be valid to all intents and purposes as a part of
the Constitution:
‘‘A RTICLE—.
‘‘S ECTION 1. The Congress shall have power to limit,
regulate, and prohibit the labor of persons under eight-
een years of age.
‘‘S ECTION 2. The power of the several States is unim-
paired by this article except that the operation of State
laws shall be suspended to the extent necessary to give
effect to legislation enacted by the Congress.’’
llll
An amendment relative to equal rights for
men and women was proposed by the 2d session
of the Ninety-second Congress on March 22, 1972,
when it passed the Senate, having previously
passed the House on October 12, 1971. The seven-
year deadline for ratification of the proposed
amendment was extended to June 30, 1982, by the
2d session of the Ninety-fifth Congress. The pro-
posed amendment, which was not ratified by
three-fourths of the States by June 30, 1982, is as
follows:
J OINT R ESOLUTION P ROPOSING AN A MENDMENT TO THE
C ONSTITUTION OF THE U NITED STATES R ELATIVE TO
EQUAL R IGHTS FOR M EN AND W OMEN
Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled (two-
thirds of each House concurring therein), That the follow-
ing article is proposed as an amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, which shall be valid to
all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution
when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the
several States within seven years from the date of its
submission by the Congress:
‘‘A RTICLE—
‘‘S ECTION 1. Equality of rights under the law shall not
be denied or abridged by the United States or by any
State on account of sex.
‘‘SEC. 2. The Congress shall have the power to en-
force, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this
article.
‘‘S EC. 3. This amendment shall take effect two years
after the date of ratification.’’
llll
An amendment relative to voting rights for
the District of Columbia was proposed by the 2d
session of the Ninety-fifth Congress on August
22, 1978, when it passed the Senate, having pre-
Page XV CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA—1787
viously passed the House on March 2, 1978. The
proposed amendment, which was not ratified by
three-fourths of the States within the specified
seven-year period, is as follows:

ing article is proposed as an amendment to the Con-
stitution of the United States, which shall be valid to
all intents and purposes as part of the Constitution
when ratified by the legislatures of three-fourths of the
several States within seven years from the date of its
submission by the Congress:
‘‘ARTICLE—

stituting the seat of government of the United States

pealed.
‘‘S EC. 4. This article shall be inoperative, unless it

eral States within seven years from the date of its sub-
mission.’’
